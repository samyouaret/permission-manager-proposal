## Suggestion to implement CASL

## What can user perform

1. A user can create/update/delete a permission.
   1. Ensure no duplication in permissions.
2. A user Can attach/Detach permissions to group/role.
   1. Attach/Detach only once.
   2. Group and permission exist when Attach/attach.
3. Provide Api to do:
   1. List All permissions.
   1. List All Groups.
   2. Get permission/group by id.
   3. List Group's Permissions.
   4. Check Group has a permission.
